%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Regularization %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As mentioned in \autoref{cf}, one way to address the stability-plasticity problem is the use of regularization. This approach adds a penalty term to the loss function of a model. Usually this penalty term depends on the model parameters. Later we will also see some methods that directly penalize the output of a model. I will begin by categorizing the regularization methods that I have found through out my research and present some selected examples. After this overview of current possibilities in regularization techniques, I will present attempts at unifying and generalizing this field.
